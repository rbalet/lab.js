Write custom logic
==================

We do our best to provide as much functionality as we can in the builder interface, but sometimes that's not enough: **Your ingenuity and creativity are tough to keep up with.**

In these cases, **when you'd like to go beyond the features that the builder provides, you can do so through small custom programs written in JavaScript.** These vastly extend the functionality provided by ``lab.js``, and allow you to customize any possible aspect of your study.

In this section, we'd like to provide a brief introduction to JavaScript, the programming language used by browsers, and show you how to use it in service of your research.
